## Overview

**GUARD3N** is a community-driven Web3 platform built during the Stellar Bootcamp that empowers Filipinos to take real environmental action through blockchain technology. Users can donate **GRE3N**  tokens to their chosen barangay park, monitor tree growth through a live GeoMap, and collect their own virtual tree. A community leaderboard tracks which barangays are leading in sustainability efforts, while country-wide milestones celebrate collective environmental progress. Built on the Stellar (Soroban) blockchain with smart contract integration-ready architecture, **GUARD3N** turns everyday micro-donations into transparent, rewarding, and community-driven green action.

_I framed it as **"integration-ready"** instead of fully implemented. Smart contract integration was designed and architected but not fully implemented due to lack of guidelines to integrate and time constrain._

## Problem

Meet Ate Teresa, 34. Quezon City.

She wakes up at 5:30am, commutes 2 hours in 38°C heat, works 9 hours, commutes back. By the time she gets home, the air feels thick and not just with pollution, but with helplessness.

She scrolls past climate news. She cares. She actually cares deeply. But what can she do? She's not rich. She's not an activist. She's just one person trying to survive the month on ₱22,000.

The barangay park two blocks away has three trees left. The rest were cut for a parking lot. Her kids can't play outside anymore — the heat is dangerous, the air is bad, and the nearest "green space" is a potted plant in SM.

She donates nothing and not because she doesn't want to, but because no one ever made it feel possible, visible, or worth it.

The real problem isn't apathy. It's invisibility.

**Filipinos care about the environment**, but the systems around them make individual action feel pointless, untraceable, and unrewarding.

---

## Solution

GUARD3N makes Ate Teresa a Guardian.
For a minimum of ₱1 , she funds a real Narra tree at Quezon Memorial Circle. She earns GR3EN tokens. She watches the barangay dashboard. She gets notified when her tree is verified on the Stellar blockchain. She shares her virtual tree card on Facebook .

Next month she does it again. And again. Until she has a collection of 12 trees across 4 parks in Metro Manila — all traceable, all real, all hers virtually.

GUARD3N doesn't ask Filipinos to sacrifice. It asks them to invest — in their city, their air, and themselves.

##  Smart-Contract-Style Logic (Win-Win System)

Everyone wins:

People win:

Ate Teresa donates ₱, earns GR3EN tokens, owns a virtual tree, and gets bragging rights on social media. Every peso she gives comes back to her in value — emotional and social.

Planet wins:
Every GR3EN token is backed by a real tree in a real park. Barangay officials submit geotagged photo proof. Admins verify on-chain. No greenwashing. No ghost trees. Just verified, growing, trackable urban forests recorded permanently on Stellar.

##  Target Users

- **Filipino donors of all ages** (students, workers, OFW families, professionals, retirees) who can afford small, regular donations (e.g., ₱50–₱200 per tree) and want their contributions visible, trackable, and rewarding.  
- **Barangay members and LGUs** managing parks, open land, or disaster‑recovery green spaces in **Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, and provincial towns**, who need transparent, community‑driven funding.  
- **Local businesses** (sari‑sari stores, cafés, fitness centers, small restaurants) in **urban and semi‑urban areas** that want low‑cost “green” branding and loyal customers without big marketing budgets.  
- **OFW families** sending money back home, who want to fund a tree in their hometown and watch it grow via photo updates instead of only sending cash that disappears into bills.
